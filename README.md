# Hospital Resource Utilization Optimizer  
### Patient-flow–driven Healthcare Analytics (Azure + PySpark + Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview

Hospitals operate with limited resources such as beds, staff, and facilities.  
Efficient utilization of these resources depends heavily on **patient flow patterns**.

This project implements an **end-to-end cloud data engineering and analytics pipeline** to analyze hospital admission data and derive insights that support **resource utilization planning**, using historical patient data as demand signals.


## 🎯 Business Objective

To help hospital administrators:
- Understand admission trends over time
- Identify emergency vs OPD demand patterns
- Analyze length of stay as a proxy for bed utilization
- Observe outcome distributions (discharge, mortality)
- Support data-driven operational planning
